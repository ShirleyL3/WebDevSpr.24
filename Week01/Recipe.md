It's been called “The Impossible Chocolate Cake” and “Magic Mexican Chocolate Flan Cake,” but I prefer calling it “Chocoflan!” 

Chocoflan is a combination of chocolate cake on the bottom with a luscious flan on top. The reason why it’s often referred to as those two nicknames is that it initially goes into the oven with the flan on top and the chocolate cake batter on the bottom, but comes out of the oven completely reversed, with the baked chocolate cake on the top and the cooked flan on the bottom. Invert the cake on a plate, and there is the flan once again on top of the cake!

#### Level: Intermediate
#### Total Time: 2 hr 20 min
#### Servings: 10

## Ingredients
### Cake Portion:
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 egg, room temp
- 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/3 cup cocoa powder
- 1 /1/4 cups buttermilk

### Flan Portion:
- One 12-ounce can evaporated milk
- one 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk
- 4 ounces cream cheese, room temp
- 3 eggs
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

### Garnish:
- 1/4 cup cajeta or caramel sauce
- 1/4 cup chopped peacans

## Directions: 
1. Put an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. 
2. Coat a Bundt pan with a little butter, then coat the bottom with 1/4 cup cajeta and put it in a large roasting pan. (The roasting pan will serve as a water bath during baking.)
3. For the cake: Add the butter and sugar to a bowl and using an electric hand mixer or stand mixer, beat until light and fluffy, then beat in the egg. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and cocoa in a medium bowl. Beat 1/3 of the flour mixture, and 1/2 of the buttermilk into the egg mixture. Repeat, ending with the flour mixture. Blend until well incorporated. 
4. For the flan: In a blender, combine the evaporated milk, condensed milk, cream cheese, eggs and vanilla. Blend on high for 30 seconds. 
5.  Scoop the cake batter into the prepared Bundt pan and spreading evenly. Slowly pour the flan mixture over the cake batter. Cover with foil and add about 1-inch of hot water to the roasting pan. 
6. Carefully slide the pan into the oven, and bake 1 hour, until the surface of the cake is firm to the touch, or an inserted toothpick comes out clean. When cake is done, remove from the water bath and cool completely to room temperature, about 1 hour.
7. Invert a large, rimmed serving platter over the Bundt pan, grasp tightly together, jiggle a little and flip over. Remove the pan and scrape any remaining cajeta from the pan onto the cake, garnish with chopped pecans and serve!
### Enjoy!
